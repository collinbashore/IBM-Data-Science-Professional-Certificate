## About this Course
This course covers the methodology implemented in Data Science that ensures
the data used in problem solving is the most relevant and manipulated properly to address the questions at hand.

The following course objectives are:
- Forming a business/research problem, collecting, and preparing & analyzing data, building a model, deploying a model and understanding the importance
of feedback
- Apply the 6 stages to the Cross Industry Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology
- Learn how Data Scientist's think&#10071;
