## Project: [U.S. Domestic Airline Flights Performance Dashboard (2005-2020)](US_domestic_airline_flights_performace.ipynb)
### Goal
- To analyze performance of the reporting airline to improve flight reliability thereby improving customer reliability
- Create two different reports in the dashboard
    - Yearly airline performance report
    - Yearly average flight delay statistics
    
#### Components of the Report Items
1.  Yearly airline performance report

    For the chosen year provide,

    *   Number of flights under different cancellation categories using bar chart.
    *   Average flight time by reporting airline using line chart.
    *   Percentage of diverted airport landings per reporting airline using pie chart.
    *   Number of flights flying from each state using choropleth map.
    *   Number of flights flying to each state from each reporting airline using treemap chart. <br><br>
2.  Yearly average flight delay statistics

    For the chosen year provide,

    *   Monthly average carrier delay by reporting airline for the given year.
    *   Monthly average weather delay by reporting airline for the given year.
    *   Monthly average natioanl air system delay by reporting airline for the given year.
    *   Monthly average security delay by reporting airline for the given year.
    *   Monthly average late aircraft delay by reporting airline for the given year.
